This project implements a simple **autonomous vehicle** that can follow a predefined black line on a white surface using an **IR reflection sensor**. The car is constructed using **LEGO elements** and controlled by an **Arduino UNO** with a motor driver.
The vehicle is designed to navigate a track autonomously by detecting and following a **black line** on a **white background**.

## Construction

The chassis was built using **LEGO** components. Two wheels powered by 12V DC motors are mounted on the base. The top of the car holds the **Arduino UNO**, a **motor driver (L293D)**, and a **battery pack** supplying power to the entire system.

## Components Used

1. **12V DC Motors with Wheels**  
2. **IR Reflective Sensor**  
3. **L293D Motor Driver**  
4. **Arduino UNO**
